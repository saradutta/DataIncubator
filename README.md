Aim of project: To condense, extract and analyze companies' annual reports. 
In this first example we look at 5 pharmaceutical industries. 
We look at the occurrence of various key words in the reports. 


# Project proposition 
The pharmaceutical industry plays a major role in people's lives. Each year they publish a comprehensive annual report on their activity and earnings. However, these reports are lengthy (often close to 100 pages) and the general public rarely reads them. My goal is to use data science to extract key information from these reports that will inform the general public and the scientific researchers like myself. Here I present preliminary results from 5 pharmaceutical/healthcare companies. I look at the frequency of specific relevant words and their correlations. During my project I will extend this study to calculate different metrics for each company, in order to better understand their key messages and main aims. This could be applied to annual reports of companies in other sectors too. 

The two figures I present here show the frequency (normalized to the total number of words in the report) of the words (patient, revenue, cancer, oncology and pediatric). We can see that for most companies the word revenue is the most frequent apart from Takeda (patient is the most frequent word). We also notice that there is a high positive correlation between the occurrence of the words pediatrics and cancer, oncology and patients and oncology and cancer. These preliminary results suggest interesting patterns can be observed between different companies and across all companies.
