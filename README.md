Aim of project: To condense, extract and analyze companies' annual reports. 
In this first example we look at 5 pharmaceutical industries. 
We look at the occurrence of various key words in the reports. 


# Project proposition 
The pharmaceutical industry plays a major role in people's lives. Each year they publish a comprehensive annual report on their activity and earnings. However, these reports are lengthy (often close to 100 pages) and the general public rarely reads them. My goal is to use data science to extract key information from these reports that will inform the general public and the scientific researchers like myself. Here I present preliminary results from 5 pharmaceutical/healthcare companies. I look at the frequency of specific relevant words and their correlations. During my project I will extend this study to calculate different metrics for each company, in order to better understand their key messages and main aims. This could be applied to annual reports of companies in other sectors too.
